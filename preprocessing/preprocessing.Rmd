Comprovem si hi ha valors buits

```{r}
# comprovar si hi ha files amb valors buits (no n'hi ha)
n_total <- nrow(df)
cat("Files totals:", n_total, "\n")
na_per_row <- rowSums(is.na(df))
n_with_na <- sum(na_per_row > 0)
cat("Files amb almenys un NA:", n_with_na, "\n")
```
## 2. Eliminem duplicats
```{r}
##Duplicats (files 100% iguals)
dup_flag <- duplicated(df) | duplicated(df, fromLast = TRUE)
cat("Files duplicades:", sum(dup_flag), "\n")
```

## 3. Generem informes inicials amb la llibreria SmartEDA per a poder fer l'anàlisi exploratori

```{r}
library(SmartEDA)
ExpReport(data = df, Target = "Target", op_file = "informe_inicial.html")
```

## 4. Eliminem outliers
application_ordre: > 7
previous_qualification_grade: > 175
admission_grade: > 175
age_at_enrollement: transformació BOX-COX
enrolled1/2: > 11
evaluations: > 11
approved: > 11
grade: transformació BOX-COX


## 5. Transformem algunes variables
enrolled: categòrica
credited: binària 0 o altres
evaluations: categòrica
aproved: categòrica
w/o evaluations: binària: 0 o altres


## 6. Generem informes finals per a comparar resultats.

```{r}
# Sense objectiu (informe general)
ExpReport(data = df, Target = NULL, op_file = "eda_general_inicial.html")

```

## 7. Desem el dataset preprocessat
```{r}
write.csv(df_clean, "clean-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
